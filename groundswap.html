            <b>Description: </b> My teammate Harmit Singh and I wanted to explore some different image matting techniques, and how
            these techniques vary when it comes to the final image product in an interactive way that would allow those unfamiliar with these
            techniques to easily discern the differences. This lead to the creation of the java application, GroundSwap
            where users can input any image of their choosing, preferably with a white background colour if they would like to be able to
            experiment with the difference matting method. The user can then select one of the four prechosen background images we
            have to offer and be able to see, step by step, their input image, the matte image generated, the background image they have chosen as well
            as the final image with the new background.

         <p> Before my partner and I began, we both individually did research by means of research papers. Our
         two main points of reference were  “A Bayesian Approach to Digital Matting” written by Yung-Yu Chuang, B. Curless, and D.H. Salesin, 2001
       and “Video Background Replacement without A Bluescreen” by Richard J. Qian and M. Ibrahim Sezan, 1999.
       <br>
       These papers helped us to get a better idea of matte image generation and originally we were very interested in replicating the "A Bayesian Approach to Digital Matting" as well but
   the calculus required was well beyond the scope of this project, given that it was an exploratory approach.
   <br>
   Thus, we proceeded having identified luminance, chrominance, difference, and colour difference as our
   four choices of matte creation and began to write our code. While we did want to implement user interaction and background changes,
   we first implemented matte creation on images that I selected based upon solid colour usage and photoshopped to fit our needs. I implemented
 the colour difference and difference matting methods, and my partner implemented chrominance and luminance (chroma and lumakey). </p>

          <p> For our final prototype, I implemented a method to check the size of the user input photo,
            located and resized photos to use for the background, added click detection for the background image selection,
            cleaned up previous code, implemented background image swap based on image selection,
            added in a button with click detection to later use to save an image,
            implemented the image save method, as well as implemented final image creation for
            colour matting and differencing matting methods.  </p>

          <p> The final result consisted of a fully working application with all of the features we expected to have in it.
            Users are able to select between the four matte creation methods and four pre-selected background images.
            Users are able to upload their own image for use, and if that image is too large it is resized automatically.
            In order to use the application to its fullest extent, we do require that the user uploads a photo with a plain
            white background, for the difference matting method to work. The user is reminded of this with a message
            on the screen. </p>

        <b>Challenges: </b>
        The biggest challenge we had for this project was deciding which matte creation techniques
        we would be able to implement, given time constraints. Naturally, we had to abandon the techniques
        for which the calculus behind them would take too long to both understand and implement. We also
        had to decide how many different methods would make our exploratory approach exciting and attractive to users.
        After much deliberation, we managed to settle on four as to keep the UI as clean and usable as possible, given
        the focus is to the functionality.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Reflection:</b>  I really enjoyed working on this project and I learned a lot during this.
      Particularly about how to ensure good communication between a partner. Harmit and I worked on this solely by communicating
    online, due to the difficulties caused by COVID-19. I learned how to navigate working on a project where the code is
    reliant on a lot of the same parts and focusing on not accidentally writing duplicate code.This
    was a challenge as it was sometimes not immediately obvious if a chunk of reusable code had already been written.
    I learned to take a minute to revisit the code if I noticed that my partner had pushed any new
    changes, as occasionally there would be some chunk of code he had written that could be slightly altered so that it works
    for both of us.
    Additionally, this project really helped me further see how these particular matte creation techniques differ and may be
    stronger in certain areas than others. </p>
