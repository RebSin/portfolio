           <b>Description: </b>  Cyberview is an exploratory game developed by myself and my teammates Robert Michels, Carter Glass and Chris Louie. For this, my role was
             mainly to develop a storyline for the game, as well as create many visual pieces. I also helped to conduct user testing.
             To read about my role in detail, visit the blog I wrote for this project.

      The first step when took when undertaking this project was to sit down as a team and generate many ideas for a game that would fit the 'exploratory' prompt.
      After that step was taken and we had determined a general idea, we then began to narrow in on factors such as
      'what is the goal of the game?', 'how can our player achieve those goals?', 'what elements comprise our setting?',
      and, the most important question 'how do we define if this game is enjoyable to play?'
      <br>
      <br>
      The only way to answer our most important question was through research. I drafted a short summary of a possible storyline and we gave it to potential
      players to read and took note of their reactions, or lackthereof, and ideated further based on these results.
      <br>
      <br> I then plotted out the finalized
      storyline onto a spreadsheet where I describe the general scene with a quick doodle and give further details regarding what happens, and why.

      While I did write some code, I mainly generated content in the forms of storyline, visuals and game design documents.
      One challenge here was making sure all of my art work looked as though they all belonged in the same universe together. I kept <thead>
      designs cohesive by giving all my enemy characters similar looking eyes.

      Through the process, we made sure to do user testing sessions with at least 3 players every week. During one especially
      valuable playtesting session, a player asked us why our main character was fighting against its fellow androids, if it is
      the humans in the game who are doing evil. This was
      an eye opener for us and we implemented this idea into our storyline, and also made the game possible to beat without
      killing a single android.

<!-- Project Challenges + Reflection -->

        <b>Challenges: </b>
        There were many challenges with this game which I played a large role in solving, as
        I worked majorly on the storyline. Many of our issues stemmed from making the game too difficult,
        as it may be easy for us due to repetitive actions. However, we solved many of these issues by
        identifying them through playtesting.
        <br> <br>
        However, playtesting was also a challenge, as it was difficult to navigate the feedback and determine
        which should be implemented and which should be put aside. Determining this is a valuable skill that I worked
        hard on developing during this project.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Reflection:</b>
        There were some issues during the final playtesting
        session that was preformed by industry professionals, such as pickups of items being unclear, but the game
        was reportedly enjoyable, if too long to have been easily completed during the session. Upon reflection, I would have liked
        to have worked more on the code if I had the chance - two of my teammates were very skilled in C# and took that
        upon themselves. I would have also liked to have taken on more, if not all, of the visual design as well, time allowing.
        <br> <br>
        However, I also did enjoy my roles as visual designer, content creator as well as tasks such as running user tests and ultimately I believe
        Cyberview was a success.
