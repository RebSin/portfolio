            idea of Evder: a website that contains all of the events that are happening in a lower mainland location of your choice and
            displays them to you in one location.

            Before I began coding anything,
            I created a quick mockup of my preferred layout in adobe illustrator.
            I wanted a very simple and easy to follow layout that would also be visually pleasing. This is that mockup of my inital idea. </p>

          This was my first time working with backend development and so developing my database design was an iterative process.
            Originally, I believed my database would be quite small, after all, I only needed to manage events and users. But as I began coding, I began
            to notice the need to add more and more tables to my database. Upon completion, I had five: events, personalization,
             posts, savedposts, and users. </p>

        <b>Challenges: </b>
        One of my most memorable challenges was when I was attempting to implement the ability for users to save events.
        I was attemping to save multiple userid's for a single event, in the events table. This was
        because I wanted to keep track of which events were saved to the accounts of which users.
        It was not until later, when saying aloud my problem, that
        I realized that I was going about it all wrong.
        This lead to the creation of a new table in my database which stores the username of
        the user, along with the event id, to be able to access that event later.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Reflection:</b>  If I were to do this again, I spend more time working on the design of my website
          as, at the time, I did not have enough time to work on the frontend side of the things.
          I would have also liked to have run some user tests, as well as developed a way
          automatically fetch event data from the web.
          <br> <br>
          As the site is now, I’m proud that I managed to get all of the functionalities required to
          work as it took me a while to learn how to do so.
          Overall, I think I ended up learning a lot by struggling through various problems
          and figuring out how to solve them. Some parts definitely required me to step back and reexamine the issue
          in order to solve the problem and I feel that this made me more capable of handling such problems in the future. </p>

              are still many placeholders as the front end design was set aside for focus on the backend.
