           We were required to use pure HTML and CSS. Both Adrian and I had interest in working on a clothing webstore, so came forth Muted.

      We weren't allowed to use any frameworks, or to create mockups. We had to rely on code only.
      Before we began this project, both my partner and I separately had created styleguides for separate companies,
      I for a fictional brand I named Bertolucci, and my partner for Muted.

      Before beginning a project, especially one that is large scale, it is typical to create mockups and wireframes.
      However, this time we were only allowed to use the code we had written, and our styleguides we had worked on before.
      This is the first time I had worked on creating a styleguide and using it made the workload much lighter. However,
      even with the style guide, the most important part of this project was speaking with our peers,
      who revealed to us problems we might have missed, such as placement or responsiveness issues.

        <b>Challenges: </b>
        The biggest challenge of this project was learning to rely on not using
        wireframes or other prototypes to help with the development. The creation of the style guide
        was particularly challenging as we were unable to see how particular pieces would look together
        beforehand. However, I think working on this site in this way made me a better designer, as
        I began to think about styling in a different way and was able to complete this assignment,
        alongside my partner, in a visually appealing way.
        <br>
        <br>
        <b> Reflection:</b>
        If I were to work on this project again, I likely would invest more time into the copywriting
        as well as putting more time into ensuring the site was properly responsive, as I am able to
        identify some issues with the responsiveness now. Additionally, I would have liked to make the
        website more realistic with fewer placeholders if possible, but I believe that even with
        the placeholders, the site is visually appealing and the interactions are clear.
        <br> <br>
        Overall, this project was very fun to work on. I especially enjoyed gaining feedback from our
        peers and our TA and incorporating those feedbacks into our work, which I feel
        made it an overall much stronger project. </p>
